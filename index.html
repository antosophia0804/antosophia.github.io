            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing an Advanced Diploma in AI, Design Analysis, and Implementation at Durham College. With a background in electronics and communication engineering and experience as a Quality Analyst, I have honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and quality assurance. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems and drive business growth.</p>
            <p>During my tenure as a Quality Analyst at Tata Consultancy Services, I developed and executed both manual and automated test cases, collaborated with AI teams to enhance processes, and implemented cognitive automation solutions to improve test accuracy and efficiency. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of AI-led quality assurance and data analysis.</p>
            <p>At Durham College, I have worked on several projects, including a Stock Prediction App and a Price Comparison Application. These projects allowed me to apply machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to real-world problems, further solidifying my technical skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and web development.</p>
            <p>My goal is to continue growing in the field of AI and Data Science, and I am eager to bring my expertise to a forward-thinking company like Capgemini, where I can contribute to innovative projects and help drive business success through data-driven insights.</p>
